                        <h1>Lift yourself: What is a bodyweight workout?</h1>
    <p>Bodyweight workouts are exercise routines that use a person’s
     own bodyweight to create resistance and improve strength, flexibility,
     and endurance, as well as coordination.
    
    You’ve probably done a push-up before — well done. You’ve
    already met bodyweight exercises. On occasion, you can use a wand or resistance band to support an exercise. 
    
    While there are bodyweight exercises you can do in a gym (pull-ups, anyone?), having a calisthenics or
    plyometrics routine meansyou can stay in shape without the need for a gym membership or expensive equipment.</p>
